We at guidemyclass would like our esteemed customers to know that we are more than happy to do everything within our power to help you with your assignment. Nonetheless, there are situations in which the assignment is overly precise or may have grave consequences. We think it's polite to turn down orders that might affect our clients' confidence in our offerings and their academic performance. Following a thorough examination, we will really reject such orders.  

These are the areas where these declines usually happen:  

1. Engineering
2. Civil Engineering
3. Construction Engineering
4. Criminology and Criminal Law
5. Criminal Justice
6. Medicine
7. Medical Sciences
8. Nursing, Aviation
9. Health Care
10. Architecture
11. Building and Planning

We won't process some orders if the focus of the order instructions is on maintaining the highest level of academic integrity in these areas.
