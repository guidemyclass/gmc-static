## Do you have any discounts?

Indeed. Check out our Prices page to see if you qualify for any discounts. If you think you qualify for a discount, please get in touch with one of our customer service representatives. We provide two types of savings. They may be one-time or ongoing for a full year.


## When will you finish writing my paper?

The deadline is up to you. The earliest usual time we can finish your order and guarantee the best quality is in 24 hours. However, we can and will help you if you require the task to be completed immediately. All you have to do is specify how many hours you have on the Order Form, and we'll get back to you in less than ten minutes with the writer's selection. As soon as you have paid and given us all required materials and instructions, the clock is ticking down to your deadline. Please be aware that your deadline only applies to the initial, unaltered draft of your article. 

Since revisions typically take longer, our service advises starting 5-7 days ahead of the paper's actual due date.



## What is Free Inquiry and how does it work?

You have the opportunity to submit a free inquiry and receive an initial assessment of your paper from our writer in addition to paying directly. We value your money above all else, therefore once you have eliminated all of the points, you can confidently pay for the order. You are welcome to use the "Inquire Now" form to try placing your orders.


## Is your service legal?

The most important thing to remember is to answer the question of whether our service is legal for yourself by determining whether learning is permitted.
That is to say, our service offers the same kind of support you would receive, example, if you sought out a tutor who was an expert in your particular field of study.
It is LEGAL and NOT against any college or university policy to use our service. If you properly cite the original work, our product—which acts as a source and raw material for your own paper—cannot be construed as plagiarism.
You should also be aware that the paper you buy from guidemyclass.com is your sole possession, and only you have access to it. It is entirely up to you how you choose to use it.


## How will I receive the completed paper?

After your project is finished, you will receive a phone call or email notification. To obtain a finished copy of your work, you must sign into your guidemyclass.com account and accept the preview version. The finalized version of your paper with a watermark is the preview version. If you are unhappy with the paper, you must carefully read the preview version and make the appropriate amendment remarks. Please request a revision rather than clicking the ACCEPT button if one is needed. You can only click the ACCEPT button once you're satisfied with the paper and would like to receive the MS Word version of it. 


## What do I do if I am not satisfied with the delivered paper?

In the event that a project revision is necessary, you are more than welcome to request one via the "Files" list on your "Personal Order Page" by providing specific feedback on the revision you would like done and when you would like it finished. Should your project necessitate substantial modifications, a rewriting fee will be charged based on the intricacy of the work and the allotted time for its completion. For comprehensive details, please refer to our Revision Policy.



## What is the word count for 1 page?

A page with single spacing has 550 words, while a page with double spacing has 275 words. Please simply indicate how many pages your essay's body will comprise. There will be no charge for the title and reference pages.



## Which formats do you provide?

Our papers are formatted free of charge in line with your specifications and instructions because we fully understand that how your completed work is presented has a significant impact on your grade. We offer Chicago, Harvard, APA, and MLA referencing styles for our papers. In the event that you, the customer, do not offer formatting instructions, our default formatting style—MLA, 12pt Arial with double spacing and a 1-inch margin—will be applied. Please be aware that all pages will automatically be double spaced and have an average word count of 275, regardless of the format you request.



## Will I have to pay for the title page and bibliography?

No. They are given away without charge. For instance, if you order a 4-page paper, you will receive six pages total: the title page, the reference page, and the five pages that make up the paper's body. Your total price will not include these pages.


## Can I be sure that my personal information is safe?

We guarantee the confidentiality of any personal information you furnish us with through our site security procedures. Your personal data is only utilized to validate your payment details, contact you in the event that there are any problems with your order, and enhance the quality of our service. We never provide your personal information to any parties. If necessary, our Customer Support Representatives will utilize this information to get in touch with you regarding any inquiries we might have regarding your paper. Please visit our Security Policy page to learn more about your privacy.


## Who will write my paper?

Before joining our service, everyone of our writers had produced a large number of essays and reports and was an expert in their particular academic and/or business subject. They have years of writing experience. They have undergone a rigorous screening process, and members of the Quality Assurance Department—who are themselves seasoned writers—have examined samples of their prior work.




## How does the price for my order form?

It is determined by 4 factors:
- Type of paper

There are also additional services which may affect the price. For details, please check our Pricing page.



## What payment methods do you accept?

## Will I be able to contact my writer directly?

Indeed. Please feel free to use our message system, which enables you to get in touch with your writer or one of our Customer Support Representatives at any time if you would want to speak with them directly. To send a message, simply look up your order number in the control panel and select the recipient. Every time there is a new message, you will be notified via email for your convenience. You are not permitted to provide the writer with your personal information or request that they provide it to you for security reasons.


## How does the guidemyclass.com work?

Using guidemyclass.com to order a paper is simple and quick. After we guarantee that we have a writer to finish your paper, pay and then wait for your assignment to be finished by the date you choose.
As soon as you are able to upload any necessary materials and provide us precise instructions, you may begin the ordering process by completing the inquiry form.  

Let's examine our service's operation in more detail: 
1. You fill the Order Form.
2. You fill out the data about yourself so we could create you an account.
3. You select whether to pay immediately, or wait until we have found a writer and pay afterwards.  

Your Personal Order Page will be automatically created for you after completing the order form. From there, you can upload any necessary materials, monitor the status of your order's completion, and mail the administrator and writer.  

Your paper is sent to your personal order page once it is finished.  

You can locate your completed paper on your order page. It will be available to you in a password-protected file that you may only access by choosing "Preview my Order" on the website. Upon reviewing the document and determining that it meets your requirements, you can click "Accept Order" to download the Microsoft Word file right away.  

If you need to make changes to the paper because you are not satisfied with it for whatever reason, you can utilize the "Request Revision" button and specify how long it will take to finish. We offer free revisions in compliance with our revision policy. The "Files" portion of your Personal Order Page is where all file sharing takes place.


## Do you store pre-written works and if so, for which purposes?

No. We take our policy on pre-written papers very seriously. Please notify one of our customer support representatives if you have any reason to think that your paper was pre-written. We will look into this topic in great detail. Should the document exhibit indications of being pre-written, you will receive a complete reimbursement.



## What if you are late with the delivery?

If a deadline is missed, it's critical to let our Customer Support Representatives know as soon as possible and provide an explanation.

In such a case, our representatives will review your case in detail and provide you with suitable choices. You need to set up a new deadline if the writer's conduct or the customer's error caused the deadline to be missed. In the event that an error occurs on our end and delays the delivery of your order, the initial cost of the paper will be adjusted and any applicable refunds will be issued.

Please be patient with us and have faith in our ability to finish the work correctly if, as a result of a revision you requested, you are unable to meet the order deadline or because you failed to include all necessary information in your order request from the beginning. There will need to be a new deadline decided upon.

Please see our Money Back Policy page for more information.


## Are your works plagiarism-free?

Indeed. All of our work is entirely unique and appropriately referenced in accordance with your guidelines. We use the website of our partner to verify that no unapproved duplication of the text exists in your paper. We do this by using it to check all of our projects for plagiarism. We take seriously our promise to be plagiarism-free, and we'll do everything in our power to keep your faith and support.


## What is the Personal Order Page and how does it work?

You can place an order, monitor its status, and upload necessary resources that might help with your tasks on the Order Personal Page. Additionally, you can message an administrator and the author of your paper using this website. For ease of use, every Personal Order Page includes:
- The "Your Orders" option lists all of your previous and ongoing projects and assists you in monitoring the status of your order with guidemyclass.com.
